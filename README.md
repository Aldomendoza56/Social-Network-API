# Social-Network-API
In this project I was assigned to make an api with routes using NoSQL. After getting the server I was supposed to showcase how the routes work. The two main routes were the get and post routes. They were supposed to show the users that already existed and were supposed to add new user as well. The biggest challenge in this project was getting the server to run properly.
